========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/caspargross/HybridAssembly.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/caspargross/HybridAssembly)

Nextflow pipeline for hybrid and long read only Assembly.
This pipeline combines different assembly methods and tools and allows for a direct comparison of the results. It is mainly suited for bacterial genomes and was created to identify plasmids in combination with [PlasmidFinder](https://github.com/caspargross/PlasmIdent)
